## Binomial Distribution
<p> In probability theory and statistics, the binomial distribution is the discrete probability distribution that gives only two possible results in an experiment, either Success or Failure. For example, if we toss a coin, there could be only two possible outcomes: heads or tails, and if any test is taken, then there could be only two results: pass or fail. This distribution is also called a binomial probability distribution.

There are two parameters n and p used here in a binomial distribution. The variable ‘n’ states the number of times the experiment runs and the variable ‘p’ tells the probability of any one outcome.</p>

## HOW TO USE THE CODE
<p> With the help of C language the Binimial Distribution code is done here the user can check for atleast r , atmost r , r , not r successes. The user just needs to input the respective values of n,r,p and then the desired output will be displayed depending upon the choice of operation </p>

## REMEMBER:
    
*  Probability cannot be greater than 1
*  r cannot be a decimal
*  r cannot be greater than n
*  Probabilty of success + Probability of failure must be equals to 1 (p+q=1)
*  n , r are positive whole numbers
