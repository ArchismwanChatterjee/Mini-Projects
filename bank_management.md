## BANK MANAGEMENT SYSTEM

Created the bank management system using C language where you can:

* Create Account
* Deposit Money
* Withdraw Money
* View Account
* View all the records
* Along with an option to exit the system

Used file handling concepts to store all the data(**_account information_**) in a file record.txt.

All the data will be added in the same file that means there will be no seperate files for each execution or running of the system.
